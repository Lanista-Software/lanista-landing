## Key Writing Rules

### Heading Hierarchy

- Exactly ONE H1 per page (the page/entry title).
- Follow sequential order: H1 -> H2 -> H3 -> H4. Never skip levels.
- Every heading must have content beneath it. No empty sections.

### Titles

- Length: 50-60 characters. Measure before committing.
- Place the primary keyword within the first 30 characters.
- Use action-oriented phrasing: "Build a REST API" not "REST API Overview".
- No clickbait, no ALL CAPS. Every title must be unique within its collection.

### Descriptions and Excerpts

- Length: 120-160 characters. Must be a complete sentence ending with a period.
- Summarize the VALUE the reader gets, not the process of writing.
- Must differ from the title.

### Body Content

- Active voice preferred. Target reading grade 8-10.
- Paragraphs: 3-5 sentences each. One idea per paragraph.
- Front-load key information in each paragraph.

### Lists

- Parallel grammatical structure across all items.
- Ordered lists for sequential steps, unordered for non-sequential items.
- Minimum 2 items in any list.

### Prohibitions

- No placeholder text: Lorem ipsum, TODO, TBD, [insert here], empty required fields.
- No duplicate content: titles, descriptions, and text blocks must be unique within a collection.

## Tone Configuration

### Reading Context

Before writing any content, check these files:

1. **`.contentrain/context.json`** -- Read `conventions.tone` and match the specified tone exactly. If absent, default to neutral professional.
2. **`.contentrain/vocabulary.json`** -- Use canonical terms exactly as defined. Respect `brand_terms` casing. Never use `forbidden_terms`. If vocabulary does not exist, maintain internal consistency.

### Content Type Voice Mapping

| Content Type | Voice | Characteristics |
|---|---|---|
| Marketing / Landing pages | Persuasive | Benefit-focused, confident, action-oriented, second person ("you") |
| Documentation / Guides | Instructional | Step-by-step, precise, imperative mood ("Run the command") |
| Error messages | Empathetic | Solution-oriented, no blame, explain what happened and what to do |
| UI labels | Concise | Consistent terminology, sentence case, no articles unless needed |
| Blog posts | Conversational-professional | Engaging, informative, first person plural ("we") acceptable |
| Changelogs | Factual | Past tense, specific, version-referenced, no marketing language |

### Consistency

- Do not shift tone mid-entry.
- Do not mix second person ("you") and third person ("the user") within the same entry.
- Maintain consistent use of contractions per project tone.

## Content Lifecycle States

Content moves through four states with specific requirements at each:

### Draft

- Focus on completeness over polish.
- ALL required fields must have real values -- no placeholders.
- Flag any fields the agent could not confidently populate.

### Review

- Vocabulary compliance: every term matches `vocabulary.json`.
- Tone consistency: matches configured tone throughout.
- Factual accuracy: all claims and references are verifiable.
- Cross-locale coverage: all target locales have corresponding entries.
- Field constraint compliance: all values within defined bounds.

### Published

ALL of the following must be true:

- Every required field is populated with final content.
- Every supported locale has a complete translation.
- Zero placeholder text anywhere.
- All relation fields reference existing, published entries.
- SEO fields (title, description, slug) are populated and valid.
- Content passes tone and vocabulary checks.

### Archived

Move content to archived status when:

- It references deprecated features, APIs, or products.
- Dates or events referenced are more than 12 months past.
- The content has been superseded by a newer entry.
- Statistics or data points are outdated and cannot be updated.

Never delete content. Archive it. Deletion is a manual human decision.

## Content Type Patterns

### Blog Post (document kind)

Hook opening -> Context paragraph -> Scannable body with H2/H3 -> Conclusion -> CTA. Do not start with "In this article, we will discuss..."

### Landing Page (singleton kind)

Hero statement (max 10 words) -> Problem -> Solution -> Features (3-6) -> Social proof -> CTA.

### Documentation (document kind)

Prerequisites callout -> Overview -> Step-by-step instructions -> Expected result -> Troubleshooting (min 2 items).

### Error Messages (dictionary kind)

What happened -> Why -> How to fix. No blame language, no technical jargon, no naked error codes.

### Form Labels (dictionary kind)

Noun or noun phrase, sentence case, no trailing colons. Helper text: one sentence with format requirements.

### Navigation Items (dictionary kind)

1-2 words maximum. Verbs for actions, nouns for destinations. No abbreviations.
